Subscription Analysis Project

📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing customer subscription data to gain insights into revenue, subscription durations, customer activity, and top-paying customers. The analysis is performed using Python, Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib, with visualizations that provide a clearer understanding of subscription trends.

🎯 Objectives

The main objectives of this project are:

1. Data Preparation & Cleaning – Generate and structure synthetic customer subscription data.

2. Subscription Duration Analysis – Understand how long customers remain subscribed.

3. Revenue Analysis – Calculate total payments and identify popular subscription types.

4. Customer Activity Analysis – Determine active vs. inactive customers.

5. Top Paying Customers – Identify the highest-paying customers and visualize them.

🛠️ Technologies & Libraries Used

* Python – Main programming language for analysis.

* Pandas – Data manipulation and processing.

* NumPy – Numerical operations and array handling.

* Matplotlib – Data visualization for trends and patterns.

* Jupyter Notebook – Development environment for interactive analysis.

📊 Steps & Implementation

1️⃣ Data Generation

A synthetic dataset of 100 customers was created with randomly assigned:

* Customer IDs

* Subscription types (Basic, Standard, Premium)

* Monthly payments based on subscription type

* Subscription start and end dates

2️⃣ Subscription Duration Analysis

* Subscription duration was calculated by subtracting the start date from the end date.

* This helped in understanding how long customers typically remain subscribed.

3️⃣ Revenue Analysis

* Total payments were calculated for each customer:Total Payment = Monthly Payment × (Subscription Duration / 30)

* The most popular subscription type was determined based on total revenue.

* A bar chart was used to visualize the revenue distribution across subscription types.

4️⃣ Active vs. Inactive Customers

* Customers were categorized as Active (subscription still valid) or Inactive (subscription expired).

* A pie chart was used to represent the proportion of active vs. inactive customers.

5️⃣ Top Paying Customers

* The top 5 highest-paying customers were identified by sorting total payments.

* A bar chart was used to highlight the highest-paying customers.

📌 How to Run the Project

1. Install necessary libraries (if not already installed):

pip install pandas numpy matplotlib

2. Open the Jupyter Notebook or run the Python script in Spyder.

3. Run the code step by step to analyze the subscription data.

📈 Insights & Learnings

* Subscription trends help understand customer retention and revenue patterns.

* The Premium plan was the most popular in terms of revenue contribution.

* A significant portion of customers were inactive, indicating possible churn.

* The highest-paying customers contributed a major share of revenue, emphasizing the importance of customer segmentation.

🚀 Future Improvements

* Incorporate real-world datasets instead of synthetic data.

* Use machine learning models to predict churn probability.

* Implement SQL database integration for real-time data analysis.

This project serves as a foundational exploration into subscription-based revenue analysis and customer retention metrics.
